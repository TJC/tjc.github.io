Do you always forget that one thing, when packing a lot of things to go camping or to a multi-day camping festival?

I do. Perhaps it will help to have a massive list, to check things off from.

Some items are optional, but I figure it's better to have everything listed, and remove the things that aren't needed, rather than the other way around.

## Clothing

 - Waterproof jacket if rain possible
 - Warm jumper/jacket/thermals if cold weather
 - Wide-brimmed hat if sunny
