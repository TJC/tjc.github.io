I used to have a blog running since 2009 on the Blogger platform, but to be honest I hadn't written anything there in years.

In an attempt to get more control over my content, and potentially get around to posting more often, I've killed off the old blog and migrated things here.

I brought over three old posts, back-dated here, just so I can have some initial content while figuring out how to use Jekyll and Github Pages.
